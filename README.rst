=============
ActionControl
=============

ActionControl is a plugin for Minecraft servers implementing the `Sponge API <https://www.spongepowered.org>`_.
It allows you to react to almost every action performed by a player on your server.
Right now, the following actions are supported:

* Breaking blocks
* Placing blocks
* Interacting with blocks
* Interacting with entities
* Using items

There are a lot more planned and will be also implemented when the Sponge API supports them.

The `ActionControl documentation <http://docs.monospark.org/actioncontrol>`_ contains all information you need to install, configure and use ActionControl, so make sure to check it out.
